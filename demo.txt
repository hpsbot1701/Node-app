I want to create a text file with 7 columns titled Time, Ax, Ay, Az, p, q ,r. 
Each column should possess 3000 rows of randomnly generated data from the range of 0:2
I have the following code.
Time =  -2 + (2+2)*rand(3000,1);
    Ax =  0 + (2+2)*rand(3000,1);
    Ay = -1 + (2+2)*rand(3000,1);
    Az =  -2 + (2+2)*rand(3000,1);
    p(angular rate along x) =  -2 + (2+2)*rand(3000,1);
    q(angular rate along y) =  -2 + (2+2)*rand(3000,1);
    r(angular rate along z) =  -2 + (2+2)*rand(3000,1);
    
    T = table(Time, Ax, Ay, Az, p, q ,r);
    writetable(T, 'SampleIMUDATA.txt');
    type SampleIMUDATA.txt
Im trying to create this text file in such a way where these numbers are randomnly generated everytime when I run the script, and overwrite the previous contents of the file SampleIMUDATA.txt
When I run the script I get the following error:
>> SampleIMUDATA
Error: File: SampleIMUDATA.m Line: 5 Column: 15
Invalid expression. Check for missing multiplication operator, missing or unbalanced delimiters, or other
syntax error. To construct matrices, use brackets instead of parentheses.
 I initally thought the dimensions of the 1 by 3000 matrix I was generating were wrong but that doesn't seem wrong so I'm wondering where the error is in dimensions.
